It's been a few years since I first started my blog, but after some time away I'm ready to start sharing with whoever might be interested in posts about travel, accessibility, and maybe some other hobbies I have.
Still working out the layout for the new site, but I'll be posting soon. And I will be brushing off the cobwebs on my social media handles.

If you have any ideas for places to check out I would love to hear them! I'll be on the East coast until the summer and then travelling out West. You can reach me at rollwithmicole@gmail.com.
